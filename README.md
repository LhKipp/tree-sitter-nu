# tree-sitter-nu - A tree-sitter grammar for the nushell language

**Info: This grammar was made for nu version ~0.45. As nushell evolves quickly, the grammar might not work perfectly for later versions. PR's are welcome**

If you are using Neovim, I recommend not using this grammar directly, but using the wrapper `https://github.com/lhKipp/nvim-nu`, which sets up this grammar and other niceties.
